    - Currently assume a master title/label won't change. It could!
- `download_xmls.sh`
  - How to log/automate a flag if the md5checksum results aren't right?
  - What if the data is not uploaded on the 01 of the month? It isn't always!
    - Run a batch job every day checking for a file?
    - No xml file exists, quit, else download?
    - Need to look at curl usage/html response from incorrect address...
- Jenkins CI
- Finish styling:
  - bootstrap?

    - how to pass on to Redis inserts?
  - Data files don't necessarily upload on `01` of month.
  - Does releases data fit into 10GB of memeory?
    - 8 million records = 42% memory usage (0.42 * 15.6 = 6.5 GB...)
    - Mongo version is 3.4
    - So SHOULD default to WiredTiger enginer
    - Shouldn't use more than 50% system memory?
